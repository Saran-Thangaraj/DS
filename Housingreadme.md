Model:
Linear Regression is the most straightforward algorithm in machine learning, it can be trained differently. In this notebook we will cover the following linear algorithms:<br>

Linear Regression<br>
Robust Regression<br>
Ridge Regression<br>
LASSO Regression<br>
Elastic Net<br>

Data:
We are going to use the USA_Housing dataset. Since house price is a continuous variable, this is a regression problem. The data contains the following columns:

'Avg. Area Income': Avg. The income of residents of the city house is located in.
'Avg. Area House Age': Avg Age of Houses in the same city
'Avg. Area Number of Rooms': Avg Number of Rooms for Houses in the same city
'Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms': Avg Number of Bedrooms for Houses in the same city
'Area Population': The population of city house is located in
'Price': Price that the house sold at
'Address': Address for the house
